# rustbonsai

a not very good clone of [cbonsai](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai)
because I wanted my own little trees (they are so small!)

## controls

- Press `q` to close at any time
- Press `d` to start showing some numbers (how many growth stages have occurred for the current tree)
- Press `n` to grow a new tree (available when the indicator is green)
- Press `c` to clear the screen (and erase your tree friends, how rude!)

## why

it was fun and I enjoyed it, thanks
